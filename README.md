# spaceX-launch-program

For server side rendering I have used Next.js as apaart from being a great framework with a great community around it, In Next.js, you don’t have to worry about bundling, minification, or hot reloading; you get a lot of features out of the box.

# static code quality checks

I have used esLint library for the standard code checks and it's going to tell you if you’ve imported something and not used it, if your function could be short-handed, and loads of other little gotchas that you can fully configure.

# CI/CD pipeline
For continous Integration and deployment I have used heroku as it is pretty simple and straight-forward with minimal configuration.
